whenever you are assigning a function to variable,
a = add()

the value which is returned by function will be stored in that variable, suppose add returns some value

print(a)
value returned by function..

In case when a function returns a nested function then,
x = add()
x()

If a function returns multiple values then it means it is returning a tuple
